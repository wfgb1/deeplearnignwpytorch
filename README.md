# Deep Learning with PyTorch

This project is a Jupyter Notebook exported as an HTML file that explores foundational concepts and techniques in deep learning using PyTorch. It serves both as a portfolio artifact demonstrating my practical skills with deep learning frameworks.

## Project Overview

The notebook includes:
- Introduction to PyTorch tensors and operations
- Building and training neural networks from scratch
- Implementing backpropagation and gradient descent
- Model evaluation and loss analysis
- Hands-on examples and code walkthroughs

## How to View

The project is provided as an HTML file for easy viewing in any browser â€” no additional setup required.

To view the notebook:
1. Clone the repository or download the HTML file.
2. Open `Deep_Learning_with_PyTorch.html` in your preferred web browser.

## Requirements

While the HTML version does not require any setup, if you want to run the code in a Jupyter environment:

- Python 3.7+
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- `matplotlib`, `numpy` (for data visualization and manipulation)

```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib numpy notebook
